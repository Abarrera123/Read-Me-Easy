  # Description 
  ## What:
   This project uses node.js to generate profesional looking README.md files.
  ## How: 
  Using node.js and inquirer, the user is asked a series of prompts. The user's answers are then used in a template that generates the README.md file.
  ## Why:
  I developed this project to help save time making README.md files.
  ## Technologies Used: 
  Node.js, Javascript, npm inquirer
  ## Purpose:
  This project solves the problem of making a README.md file from scratch for every project you complete
  # Installation:
  Once you clone the repo, change your directory to the Read-Me-Easy folder. Once in the folder you open your terminal and type 'node index.js'. After this command the user will be provided a series of prompts. Once the user answers all the prompts a README.md file will be created inside the folder. The file will have the same name as the title of your project.
